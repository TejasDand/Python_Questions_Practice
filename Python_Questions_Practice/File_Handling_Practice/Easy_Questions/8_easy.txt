How can you close a file after opening it in Python? Why is it important?

Answer:


To close a file, we use:

file.close()

Closing a file is very important for these reasons:

✅ Frees system resources:
Your operating system has a limit on how many files can be open at once.
Closing files ensures you don’t run into issues or leaks.

✅ Saves data properly:
If you're writing to a file, the data may be stored in a buffer (temporary memory).
Closing the file forces Python to write all remaining data to disk.

✅ Avoids file corruption:
If you don’t close the file and your program crashes or stops unexpectedly, it may lead to incomplete or corrupt files.
