What is the difference between  'w' and  'a' modes in file handling?

Answer: 


In Python file handling:

'w' (write mode):
This mode creates a new file or overwrites the existing file.
Each time you write using 'w', it erases all previous content and starts fresh.

'a' (append mode):
This mode preserves the existing content of the file and adds new content to the end.
You can append as many times as you want without losing old data.
